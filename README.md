After tried almost all out of the box distros, i decided to take the best parts (for me), and with divine help,
 to make my config work. At least now i know where the errors are. 



```

# required
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak

```

Reminder: 
Clone this as nvim directory
