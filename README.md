After tried almost all out of the box distros, i decided to take the best parts (for me), and with divine help,
to make my config work. At least now i know where the errors are.

```

# required
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak

```

Reminder:
Clone this as nvim directory

I updated some of the options (especialy the archive of null ls) by taking most configs from https://github.com/hendrikmi/neovim-kickstart-config/tree/main
